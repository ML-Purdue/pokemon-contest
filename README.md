## Some helpful resources

### Links to help host it on Google Drive:
- (https://towardsdatascience.com/pro-tip-for-downloading-custom-datasets-in-colab-environment-5413896d14ec) - download zipped file and upload to Drive
- (https://www.vsaytech.com/deep-learning/google-drive-google-colab-github-dont-just-read-do-it/) - mount Drive to Colab, clone repo, and more
- (https://bebi103a.github.io/lessons/02/git_with_colab.html) - open a repo on Colab

### Links to load the dataset:
- (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/pandas_dataframe) - load a pandas dataframe as a dataset
- (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images) - load a dataset and preprocess images

### Links for preprocessing help:
- (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/) - contains documentation on most, if not all the methods you'll use for preprocessing

### Links to help build an image classification neural network:
- (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) - TensorFlow documentation for building a CNN
- (https://medium.com/m2mtechconnect/classifying-pok%C3%A9mon-images-with-machine-learning-79b9bc07c080) - Medium article that walks you through building a Pokemon classifier (not good enough to win, though!)
